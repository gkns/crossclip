# CrossClip
------------------------------------

Fork of: https://github.com/yue/crossclip

In the works: Sync on LAN P2P instead of Broadcast.


------
Sync clipboard across macOS/Linux/Windows on LAN.

Written in Node.js, with native UI powered by [the Yue library](https://github.com/yue/yue).

## How to use

* Download the software from [Releases page](https://github.com/yue/crossclip/releases).
* You will be asked to fill some information on first run, you should at least
  change "channel" and "key" to unique strings.
* Repeat on your other computers, and make sure the port/channel/key are same.

## Notes

* Only plain text are synchronized, there is currently no plan to implement file
  copy/paste.
* The network part is implemented by broadcasting UDP messages on LAN, so large
  text in clipboard could fail to be sent. There is plan to rewrite the network
  code with a proper P2P library to support sending large text.

## Contributions

I do not plan to spend too much time maintaining this project, so if you want to
add a major new feature, I would suggest forking this project instead of sending
a pull request, and I would be very happy to add a link to your fork here.

Bug reports and fixes would still be very much appreciated.
